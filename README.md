# Quiz-Maker
A  prototype version of a GUI Java program that makes quizzes out of given studying material. 
Takes a PDF file as an input and uses it to generate a short quiz, with a purpose of letting 
the student know how well they have mastered the material. The current version only takes PDFs, 
and the text in the file has to be in a specific structure (statements followed by bullet points).  
Possible ways of refining this program: NLP techniques can be implemented in order to enable a 
wider variety of possible inputs. More functionality could be added as well, for example, allowing 
the user to specify how many questions they want the quiz to contain.
